# Roam

A Roku remote that puts users first

## TODO

- Prepare for AppStore
    - Get AppIcon from Maggie if she wants to
    - Update color scheme after getting app icon
    - Get screenshots from multiple devices, widgets
    - Get presentation images from Fiverr (or procreate?)
- Bugs
    - On iOS, when volume zero, volume down press doesn't work to change roku volume
        - Need an approach like this https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/649183 to sync phone audio with device audio
    - Sometimes I get a big delay with sent keys and then they all queue up and blast through after they aren't relevant anymore
        - Either use ECPSession for button presses
