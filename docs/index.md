If headphones mode doesn't work with Roam, but works with the official Roku app, please share your Roku's model name and any other relevant information in an email to [roam-support@msd3.io](mailto:roam-support@msd3.io).

        -   Click "Send feedback". This will generate a diagnostic report that can be shared with roam support (roam-support@msd3.io)
