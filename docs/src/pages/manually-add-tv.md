# Manually Adding a TV

1. Find your TV's IP Address
    - Turn on your TV and navigate to **Settings** > **Network** > **About**
    - The IP Address should look like 10.x.x.x, 172.x.x.x, 173.x.x.x or 192.168.x.x
2. Navigate to Roam settings and click "Add a device manually"
3. Name your device however you want to, and enter the device IP exactly as shown on the Roku TV
4. Click Save. Now your Roku should be able to connect and function normally

## What if you add the TV manually and Roam still can't connect?

If Roam still can't control your Roku, please try the following steps

-   Make sure your iOS device is connected to the same WiFi network as your Roku TV
