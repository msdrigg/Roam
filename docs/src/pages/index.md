## Common Issues

-   What can I do if Roam doesn't auto-discover my TV
    -   [See here](/manually-add-tv)
-   Why doesn't headphones mode (a.k.a. private listening) work on my TV?
    -   Headphones mode currently isn't working on some TV's. If headphones mode doesn't work with Roam, but works with the official Roku app, please share your Roku's model name and any other relevant information in an email to [roam-support@msd3.io](mailto:roam-support@msd3.io). Your report will help me figure out where to look when trying to fix this bug.
-   What if I have another problem or just want to provide feedback?
    -   If it's a bug, it will be best to go initiate a feedback report from the application
        -   Go into the Roam app and open the settings page
        -   Click "Send feedback". This will generate a diagnostic report that can be shared with roam support (roam-support@msd3.io)
        -   If your app is crashing, also make sure your analytics are turned on in Settings -> Privacy & Security -> Analytics & Improvments
            -   Turn on "Share iPhone & Watch Analytics" and then turn on "Share With App Developers" so apple will report to me when your app crashes
    -   If it's a request for a new feature, you can send an email directly (roam-support@msd3.io) or chat with me directly in the Roam app (Settings -> Chat with Developer)
